Parent Page: [[Cover]]

Partial Cover means that so long as the cover remains physically between the target and the attacker all actions that would **Direct Hit** a target instead **Partial Hit** and all actions that would **Partial Hit** instead miss.

If you are behind Partial Cover and take damage , you may change your stance to [[Crouched]] or [[Prone]], which may change the partial cover to [[Full Cover]] and keep you protected from future damage.

For Example: Let's say your character uses the [[Fire a weapon]] Action over waist high cover. You are no longer completely [[Crouched]] behind the cover, so it becomes Partial Cover. You choose to remain that way so that you can fire with your [[Return Fire]] [[Reflex Action]]. An enemy uses [[Fire a weapon]] and you [[Return Fire]]. You lose the [[Challenge Test]], but because you have Partial Cover, you take no damage. You then choose to use become [[Crouched]] to put yourself back in [[Full Cover]]
