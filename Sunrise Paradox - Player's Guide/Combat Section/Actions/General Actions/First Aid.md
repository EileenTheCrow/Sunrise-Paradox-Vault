Cost: 2 Cards

You may expend 2 cards to do basic first aid techniques. If you or an ally within 5ft took damage since the end of your last turn, you may regain [[Health]] equal to your [[Physique]] value up to the amount of damage you took. You may not [[Administer Stims]] and [[First Aid]] in the same turn.

You may alternatively use [[First Aid]] to clear 1 tier of a condition effecting you.
