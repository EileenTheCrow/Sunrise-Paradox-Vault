Cost: 3 Cards
 
You may expend 3 cards to swing a melee weapon at a target within the melee weapons range. If the target is Alert (See: [[Awareness]]) they may use their [[Actions#Reflex Actions|Reflex Actions]] to respond. Based on the action the target took they will either receive a direct hit or a partial hit. 

##### Direct Hit
On a **direct hit**, the target's [[Health]] becomes 0 and they are put into critical condition and must make a Resilience check. On a failure they are killed, on a success they remain in Critical Condition. (See: [[Health Status]]).

##### Partial Hit
On a **partial hit** the target takes damage equal to the highest card expended plus the melee weapons damage value. If an ace was also played as a damage card, the highest cards value is doubled.
