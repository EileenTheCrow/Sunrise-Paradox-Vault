Cost: 3 cards

You may expend 3 cards on your turn to fire a weapon. When you fire, choose between 1-3 cards expended to be used as damage cards. Set each card used as damage aside to represent how much ammo your weapon has fired. The cards not used as damage cards are instead placed in the discard pile Once the number of damage cards set aside is equal to the Magazine size of your weapon, the weapon must be reloaded before it may fire again. The number of damage cards used cannot exceed the remaining magazine size of the weapon. The magazine can be refilled by using a [[Reload a weapon]] action. 

When determining damage, face cards are considered to be 0 damage, while aces double the damage of another card player. It is important then to consider whether you believe you can land a direct hit. If you can't then face cards are a good way to attack without having to reload your weapon as quickly.

If the target is Alert (See: [[Awareness]]) they may use [[Reflex Action|Reflex Actions]] to respond you firing. Based on the action the target took, they will either receive a direct hit or a partial hit. 

##### Direct Hit
On a **direct hit**, the target takes damage equal to the value of each damage card expended. Aces double the value of another damage card.

##### Partial Hit
On a **partial hit**, the target takes damage equal to the highest played damage card. If an Ace was also played as a damage card, the highest cards value is doubled.
