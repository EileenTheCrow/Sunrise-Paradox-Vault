Cost: 3 Cards

You may use this [[Actions#Reflex Actions|Reflex Actions]] whenever you see a target [[Move]] on their turn, use a [[Actions#Ranged Actions|Ranged Action]], or during the first round of [[Combat]]. Only one creature may Return Fire in response to an opponent. You may then [[Fire a weapon]] at the target and determine the outcome. If an opponent was using the [[Fire a weapon]] action targeting you, you and your target make a [[Challenge Test]] using your [[reflex]] scores. Whoever succeeds deals a partial hit to their opponent, whoever fails misses their attack.
