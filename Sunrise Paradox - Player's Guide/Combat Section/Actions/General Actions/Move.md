Cost: 1+ cards

At any time, you may discard cards to move. The number of cards you discard can increase your speed, make you harder to hit while moving, or allow you to move in response to the actions of others. When you choose to move the cost by selecting which of the attributes the move is being made with:

- +1-3 cards - Speed: For each card used for the speed attribute, you may move a distance up to your speed
- +1 card - Reflex: You may use this action in response to an action being taken. Direct hits within 5ft become Partial hits. If you finish moving with [[Full Cover]] between you and the source of a hit farther than 5ft, the hit misses instead. You are not required to move any distance to gain these effects, however the effects immediately end once the action being responded to has been resolved.
Movement cannot be split between actions. If you take the move action and then stop to take a different action, you lose any remaining movement.
