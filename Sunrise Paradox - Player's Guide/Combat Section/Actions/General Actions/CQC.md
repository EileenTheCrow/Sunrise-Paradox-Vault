Cost: 3 cards

You expend 3 cards to enter close quarters combat with a nearby target. If you are within 5ft of your target and you have a melee weapon readied, you may do one of the following options:

##### Disarm
You and the target must make a contested [[Brawn]] [[Challenge Test]]. If you succeed you may take the weapon they are currently wielding and throw it anywhere within 30ft. If you fail, the target may deal a partial hit to you with their equipped weapon so long as it is not a bolt action or heavy weapon.

##### Takedown
You and the target must make a [[Brawn]] [[Challenge Test]]. Your target may make the [[Challenge Test]] with either [[Brawn]] or [[Agility]]. If you succeed, the targets speed becomes 0, they are prone, and they can only attack with melee weapons. They must use an [[Attempt a Skill Test]] action to attempt another [[Brawn]] [[Challenge Test]] to end this effect. If you fail, the target deals a partial hit if they have a melee weapon readied. If you move away from your target or unready your melee weapon, the effect ends.

##### Submission
When you take this action while a target is effected by [[#Takedown]] you may make a 
[[Swing a melee weapon]] action against them. This attack cannot be reduced to a partial hit or responded to by any [[Actions#Reflex Actions|Reflex Actions]] . If the target has a melee weapon other than bare fists readied, they may expend 2 cards to make a contested [[Brawn]] [[Challenge Test]]. If they succeed the hit becomes a partial hit.
