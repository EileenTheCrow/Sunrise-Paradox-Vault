### Actions
Whenever a round begins, all players draw 7 cards from their deck. The [[Maker]] draws 1 card for each Actor. All players choose one card to discard to decide their turn order with the maker using one card for each Actor they control (see [[Turn Order]]). During a players turn, they can expend cards to take certain actions. These actions cost anywhere between 0-4 cards. When cards are expended they are placed down in front of you. Some actions a player takes are affected by the values present on the cards placed. Additionally, some actions require expended cards to be designated for other purposes, such as to represent the number of attacks a firearm can make before it must be reloaded. Once the action has been resolved, all undesignated cards are put into the discard pile.

#### Discard Pile
Over the course of combat you will discard cards into a discard pile as you use actions. This process represents a players dwindling energy in a fight, as they continue to burn through their stamina until reaching exhaustion. Whenever a player needs to recover cards from the discard pile, they may do so by a few means. 

The first method is by using adrenaline to recover cards from the discard pile. A player may choose to spend 10 adrenaline at the start of their turn to shuffle their discard pile into their deck.

The second method is by entering a **Recovery** state. A player may choose to enter **Recovery** at the start of their turn. When a player enters Recovery, they shuffle their discard pile into their deck, get 1 tier of [[Fatigue]], and end their turn. Until the start of their next turn, that player can only use the [[Move]] action.


#### Reflex Actions
Some actions are tagged with the "Reflex" tag. These actions are special actions that can be used to respond to other actors in combat. To use a Reflex Action you must have the amount of cards needed in your hand and the triggering action must occur. A triggering action can only be responded to by one Reflex Action.
