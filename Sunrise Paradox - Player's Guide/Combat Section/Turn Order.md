Parent Page: [[Combat]]

Whenever a situation is determined to be High [[Threat]] by the [[Maker]], combat begins. Each player draws their hand of cards and the [[Maker]] draws 1 card for each hostile actor. The players all expend 1 card as their turn order card. Once all players have expended their turn order card, the [[Maker]] assigns the cards they drew to every hostile actor. Each actor then adds their reflex score to the turn order card's value. The turn order is determined by the order of these values from largest to smallest. If two actors are tied in their turn order, the one with the highest [[Reflex]] goes first. If the actors are still tied, they reveal cards from their deck until one actor reveals a higher value card then the other.
