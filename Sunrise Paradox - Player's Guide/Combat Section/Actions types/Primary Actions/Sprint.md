Parent Page: [[Actions]]

You can use your [[Primary Action]] to sprint. This allows you to move a distance equal to twice your [[Speed]]. Opponents may use their reflex actions to respond. While sprinting all hits cannot be greater than a partial hit. While sprinting you cannot be [[Crouched]] or [[Prone]] and will not receive [[Full Cover]] from objects that require you to be crouched to do so.
