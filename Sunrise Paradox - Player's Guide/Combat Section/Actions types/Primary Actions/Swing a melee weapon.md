 Parent Page: [[Actions]]
 
You may use your [[Primary Action]] to swing a melee weapon at a target within the melee weapons range. If you used your [[Secondary Action]] or [[Reflex Action]] to move towards the target the attack is a charge attack. If the target is Alert (See: [[Awareness]]) they may use their [[Reflex Action]] to respond. Based on the action the target took they will either recieve a direct hit or a partial hit. 

##### Direct Hit
On a **direct hit** the target is put into critical condition and must make a Resilience check. On a failure they are killed, on a success they remain in Critical Condition (See: [[Health Status]]).

##### Partial Hit
On a **partial hit** the target takes damage equal to the melee weapons damage value.
