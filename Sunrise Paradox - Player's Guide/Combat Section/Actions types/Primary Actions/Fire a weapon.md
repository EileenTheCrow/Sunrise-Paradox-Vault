Parent Page: [[Actions]]

You can use your [[Primary Action]] to fire a weapon. When you fire a weapon you may fire any number of bullets equal to or less than the "Optimal Fire" value. if you fire more than the optimal value, you must make a Weapon Condition check. If the target is Alert (See: [[Awareness]]) they may use their [[Reflex Action]] to respond. Based on the action the target took, they will either receive a direct hit or a partial hit. 

##### Direct Hit
On a **direct hit**, if the number of bullets multiplied by the Weapons damage value is equal to or greater than the targets [[Health]], they are put into critical condition and must make a Resilience check. On a failure they are killed, on a success they remain in Critical Condition (See: [[Health Status]]).

##### Partial Hit
On a **partial hit**, the target takes damage equal to the weapons damage value.
