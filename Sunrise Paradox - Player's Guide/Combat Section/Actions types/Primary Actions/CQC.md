You may use your [[Primary Action]] to enter close quarters combat with them. If you are within 5ft of your target you may do one of the following options:

##### Disarm
You and the target must make a contested [[Brawn]] [[Challenge Test]]. If you succeed you may take the weapon they are currently wielding and place it anywhere within 30ft. If you fail, the target may deal 1 partial hit to you with their equipped weapon so long as it is not a bolt action or heavy weapon.

##### Takedown
You and the target must make a [[Brawn]] [[Challenge Test]]. Your target may make the [[Challenge Test]] with either [[Brawn]] or [[Agility]]. If you succeed, the targets speed becomes 0, they are prone, and they can only attack with melee weapons. They must use there [[Primary Action]] to attempt another [[Brawn]] [[Challenge Test]] to end this effect. If you fail, the target deals a partial hit if they have a melee weapon readied.

##### Submission
When you take this action while a target is effected by [[#Takedown]] you may make a 
[[Swing a melee weapon]] action against them. This attack cannot be made into a partial hit by the [[Dodge]], [[Find Cover]], or [[Return Fire]] [[Reflex Action ||Reflex Actions]]. If the target has a melee weapon other then bare fists readied, they may make a contested [[Brawn]] [[Challenge Test]]. if they succeed the hit becomes a partial hit.
