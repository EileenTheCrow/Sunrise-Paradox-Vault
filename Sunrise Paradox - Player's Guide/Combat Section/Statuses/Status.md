Statuses are effects that persist on actors for a set amount of time or until cleared. These effects can either be enhancements, detriments, or both. When a status is applied to an actor it persists for 3 turns unless otherwise stated. If the same status is applied it increases the status intensity by 1 tier to a maximum of 3.

Some statuses are referred to as Permanent Statuses. These statuses have an infinite duration and can only be cured by special means, which are described in the corresponding status page.
