## Basic Principles
### Actors
An actor is considered anything that is capable of taking actions during combat. This includes player characters and non-player characters, including those that are hostile or that are not living creatures. Anything that is not capable of taking actions is considered an object.

Actors are split into two categories: allied or hostile. These categories are determined by the player that controls the actor. Your character is always considered your ally for the purposes of combat.

### The Grid
Combat is assumed to take place on a grid. Measurements are always given in spaces, with 1 space roughly translating to a 5ft across. The kind of grid used may change some measurements, such as those defined in the Zoning section.

## The Deck
### Cards
Cards in combat are used differently then in [[Skill Test|Skill Tests]]. A card's value in combat is determined by the number on the card. If the card is a face card, it is considered a 0 unless otherwise specified. In general, higher value cards are better in combat. A cards value is read whenever it is expended for [[Turn Order]] or for [[Actions]]. After a card has been expended it is either moved to an assigned pile or a discard pile.

#### Revealing cards
A player may be asked to reveal a card from their deck during the course of the game. A player reveals cards by pulling a card from the top of their deck and showing it to the other players at the table. If an effect calls for more then one card to be revealed then the player continues to show the top cards of their deck until the reveal the amount specified or can no longer reveal cards. If a player has no more cards to reveal from their deck, then the remaining amount of revealed cards needed is assumed to be 0.

### Discard Pile
The discard pile represents the dwindling energy and focus of an actor during combat. Whenever a card is expended, it is typically placed into the discard pile once the associated action is resolved. This pile is kept separate from the deck. Cards in the discard pile cannot be drawn from directly. When combat ends, all cards in the discard pile are shuffled back into a players deck. If a player makes a [[Skill Test]] during combat, they must only use the cards remaining in their deck, regardless of if they have enough to draw the normal amount. If a player runs out of cards during a [[Skill Test]] in combat, the skill test is resolved with the cards that were remaining. If no cards are in the deck, the player automatically fails all 
[[Skill Test|Skill Tests]].

#### Recovering Cards
There are two methods that an actor can use to recover cards from the discard pile:

The first method is by using adrenaline. A player may choose to spend 8 adrenaline at the start of their turn to shuffle their discard pile into their deck. For every time this is done, the cost to recover the deck is doubled until combat has ended.

The second method is by entering a **Recovery** state. A player may choose to enter **Recovery** at the start of their turn. When a player enters Recovery, they shuffle their discard pile into their deck, get 1 tier of [[Fatigue]], and end their turn. Until the start of their next turn, that player can only use the [[Move]] action.
### Assigned Piles
Some effects make use of expended cards in order to track important information. These piles are referred to as assigned piles. Assigned piles function the same as the Discard Pile, but they are kept separate from the Discard Pile unless otherwise stated. As an example, when an actor uses the [[Fire a weapon]] action, the actor may chose which cards expended are used for damage. All cards that are used for damage are put in an assigned pile to represent how much of that weapons ammunition has been used. The [[Reload a weapon]] action moves a weapons assigned pile back to the deck. If an assigned pile is still remaining whenever combat ends, it is added back to the deck.

## Rounds, Turn Order, and Turns
### Rounds
A round is the process of going through the turn order from start to finish. A round is complete whenever every Actor in the turn order has been given a turn. Rounds are sometimes used as measurements of time for the duration of certain effects. When an effect specifies a number of rounds, it will always end at the end of the turn order following the specified number of rounds. The round the effect begins is counted as a round for tracking these durations. As an example, if an effected was stated to last for 3 rounds, it would continue to the end of the current round, plus the end of the two subsequent rounds.

A round is equivalent to 10 seconds of time. This is important for tracking durations that specify lengths of time instead of a number of rounds.

### Turns
During combat, each actor is given a turn to effect the fight to their advantage. Actors use their turns to take [[Actions]], such as moving, attacking, or using other special abilities. When an actor begins their turn they may choose to discard any cards in their hand. They then draw cards from their deck, up to a maximum hand size of seven. Once an actor has drawn cards, they may choose to expend those cards on [[Actions]] (see Cards and Actions). If an actor has any cards remaining in their hand at the end of the turn, they may use those cards to use [[Reflex Action|Reflex Actions]] on other actor's turns.
