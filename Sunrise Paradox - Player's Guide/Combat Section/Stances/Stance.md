Parent Page: [[Combat]]

Your stance is important for the purposes of determining your [[Speed]] and [[Cover]]. An actor in combat can either be [[Standing]], [[Crouched]], or [[Prone]]. An actor may change stances at the start and end of the [[Push to Cover]], [[Run]], or [[Find Cover]] actions or when they end a [[Sprint]] action. An actor may also become [[Crouched]] or [[Prone]] in response to taking damage (See: [[Cover]])
