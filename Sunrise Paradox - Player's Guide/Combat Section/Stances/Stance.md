Parent Page: [[Combat]]

Your stance is important for the purposes of determining your [[Speed]] and [[Cover]]. An actor in combat can either be [[Standing]], [[Crouched]], or [[Prone]]. An actor may change stances at the start and end of the [[Move]] action. An actor may also become [[Crouched]] or [[Prone]] in response to taking damage. (See: [[Cover]]) An actor that changes stances from [[Crouched]] to [[Standing]] or from [[Prone]] to [[Standing]] during a [[Move]] action must use 15ft of their movement to do so. Another actor may use an [[Assist]] action to change an actors stance to [[Standing]].
