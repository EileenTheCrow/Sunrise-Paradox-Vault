You can use your [[Secondary Action]] to enter a Marksman's stance. While in this stance your damage dealt by ranged weapons is doubled. The stance is exited when you take an action other than the [[Fire a weapon]] action.

##### Level 2: 
You may spend an extra bullet to choose a second target when you take the [[Fire a weapon]] action. That target receives a Partial Hit.
