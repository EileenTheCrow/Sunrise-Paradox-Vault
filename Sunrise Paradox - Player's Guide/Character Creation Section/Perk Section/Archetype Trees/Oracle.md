An Oracle is able to effect time in the same way the [[Super Structures]] can: glimpsing into other timelines and even going so far as to warp causality to accomplish their goals. An oracle's abilities are useful in manipulating the outcomes of their allies and opponents, but they also specialize in being able to reverse or accelerate events in a fight.

### Glimpse
##### Level 1: 
Whenever you make a [[Skill Test]], you may look at the top card of your deck and chose to put it on the bottom or top of your deck.

##### Level 2: 
Whenever you or someone you can see makes a [[Skill Test]], you may spend 1 [[Adrenaline]] to replace any card revealed during the skill test with the next card in the deck. You may use this ability after revealing a card, but before any effects take place (See: [[Skill Test]]).

##### Level 3: 
Whenever you empower a [[Skill Test]], you may spend 2 additional [[Adrenaline]] to [[Glitch]] it. This does not count towards the aces needed to create a paradox (See: [[Glitch]]). If you get an Ace during this process you may glitch a 3rd time. 



### Reverse
##### Level 1:
Whenever someone you can see uses a [[Reflex Action]] you may choose to cancel it and the target loses their [[Reflex Action]]. You may only do this once per round.

##### Level 2: 
Whenever you or someone you can see takes damage, you may spend 2 [[Adrenaline]] to undo the source of that damage. The target recovers the hp they lost. If the source of the damage can move on it's own, you may move it 15 ft in any direction.

##### Level 3:
You may spend 3 [[Adrenaline]] to put one target you can see within 30ft into stasis for 2 rounds. The targets [[Health]] cannot be changed, they cannot be moved, and they cannot take actions. At the end of your turn on the 2nd round, you may choose to have the target regain [[Health]] equal to your [[Mind]].


### Accelerate
##### Level 1:
You may use your [[Secondary Action]] to accelerate an ally. That player may take a [[Primary Action]] instead of their [[Secondary Action]] on their next turn.
