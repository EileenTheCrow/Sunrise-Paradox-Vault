Psychics are those that have learned (or possible been infected with) the [[Super Structures]]' otherworldly knowledge on how to bend the mind and space. A psychic is able to alter the perceptions of someone's mind directly or rapidly warp large areas of space to move, bend, or destroy anything within it. A psychic specializes in causing large disruptions in their opponents formations or completely disabling a single target.

### Gravity
##### Level 1:
As a [[Primary Action]], you may spend up to 3 [[Adrenaline]] to pick 3 living targets you can see within 15ft of each other. Reveal cards from the deck equal to the amount of [[Adrenaline]] spent. Those targets take that much damage. If they use a [[Find Cover]] [[Reflex Action]], they may divide the damage by their [[Physique]] value.

##### Level 2:
As a [[Primary Action]], you may spend 4 [[Adrenaline]] and pick a target within 100ft of you. All living things within 30ft of the target take 6 damage if they move and 3 damage if they do not move at the end of their turn. This effect lasts for the next 2 round.

### Psychosomatic
##### Level 1:
As a [[Primary Action]], pick a target you can see within 100ft. Until the end of your next turn, that target is effected by one of the following effects of your choice:
- They cannot take a [[Primary Action]].
- They must use their [[Secondary Action]] to [[Run]] directly away from you.
- They lose their [[Reflex Action]].

##### Level 2:
Targets effected by Psychosomatic take damage equal to half your [[Mind]] value rounded down. You may additionally select one of the following effects to inflict upon them, in addition to the Level 1 effect:
- They cannot regain [[Health]].
- They cannot enter [[Stealth]].

##### Level 3:
Targets affected by Psychosomatic move at half [[Speed]] and gain a level of [[De-sync]]. If they gain 3 levels of [[De-sync]] they die.
