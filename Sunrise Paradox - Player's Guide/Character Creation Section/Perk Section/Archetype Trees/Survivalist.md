Melee Combat

### Traversal
##### Level 1:
Whenever you move, crouching does not effect your speed. Additionally, the first time you are attacked with the [[Fire a weapon]] or [[Swing a melee weapon]] action, you may take the [[Find Cover]] or [[Dodge]] [[Reflex Action]] without expanding your [[Reflex Action]] for this round.

##### Level 2:
You may spend 2 [[Adrenaline]] at the start of your turn to enter an Agile Stance, which you remain until you choose to return to your normal stance. While in this stance, your [[Speed]] increase by 10ft and you may move 10ft anytime you take the [[Swing a melee weapon]] or [[Fire a weapon]] actions. This movement cannot be responded to by a [[Reflex Action]]. While in this stance you can only take the following [[Primary Action|Primary Actions]] and [[Secondary Action|Secondary Actions]]: [[Fire a weapon]], [[Swing a melee weapon]], [[CQC]], [[Push to Cover]], [[Sprint]], and [[Run]]. You are still able to take all your reflex actions.

##### Level 3:
Whenever you enter Agile Stance you cannot be targeted by the [[Return Fire]] [[Reflex Action]] until the end of your next turn. Additionally, may take [[First Aid]] or [[Switching Weapons]] actions while in Agile Stance.


### Target Spotted
##### Level 1:
When [[Turn Order]] is first decided, you may pick a single target you can see. Until either you or that target dies or enters [[Critical Condition]], the target takes 2 additional damage from all sources and if you or an ally of yours moves they may move an additional 10ft so long as they end their turn closer to that target then they started.

##### Level 2:
You may effect an additional target with your [[#Target Spotted]] ability. Additionally, when the [[Fire a weapon]] or [[Swing a melee weapon]] action are used against the targets, they lose 1 [[Adrenaline]].

##### Level 3:
Targets effected by your Target Spotted ability cannot [[Sneak]]. Additionally, the first time you use the [[Return Fire]] or [[#Brutal Counter]] action on someone effected by the Target Spotted ability it does not expand your [[Reflex Action]] for this round.

Additionally, you gain the following special [[Reflex Action]] against targets effected by your [[#Target Spotted]] ability.

###### Brutal Counter
(Reflex Action - requires a melee weapon)
If a target within your melee range attempts the [[Run]], [[Sprint]], [[First Aid]], [[Throw an Item]], [[Administer Stims]], [[Fire a Weapon]], [[Push to Cover]], or [[Reload a Weapon]] actions you may use a [[Reflex Action]] to make a [[Swing a melee Weapon]] attack against them. 


### Deathly Precision
##### Level 1:
When you perform a [[Swing a melee weapon]] Action, you may spend 2 [[Adrenaline]] to enhance it. When you do, if the target does not [[Dodge]], you may use the [[Swing a melee weapon]] action an additional time. If the target does [[Dodge]], they lose 3 [[Health]] at the start of each of their turns until they use the [[First Aid]] action. If they use a [[First Aid]] action while effected by this ability, the effect ends and they regain no [[Health]].

##### Level 2: 
Whenever you deal damage to a target using a [[Swing a melee weapon]] action you may also take a [[CQC]] action at no additional cost. Additionally, you may choose to use either [[Brawn]] or [[Agility]] during [[CQC]] contests.

##### Level 3:
If you take a partial hit from a melee weapon and you currently have a melee weapon readied then you take 0 damage instead.
Additionally, if you either kill or put a target in [[Critical Condition]] using [[CQC#Submission|Submission]] then you regain 5 [[Adrenaline]].
