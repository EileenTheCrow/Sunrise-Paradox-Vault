An Oracle is able to effect time in the same way the [[Super Structures]] can: glimpsing into other timelines and even going so far as to warp causality to accomplish their goals. An oracle's abilities are useful in manipulating the outcomes of their allies and opponents, but they also specialize in being able to reverse or accelerate events in a fight.

## Oracle Trees
### Glimpse
##### Level 1: 
###### Delay Fate
Type: Passive

Whenever you make a [[Skill Test]], you may look at the top card of your deck and chose to put it on the bottom or top of your deck. Whenever you draw cards at the start of a round of combat, you may put one card from your hand on the bottom of the deck and draw a card.

##### Level 2: 
###### Tempt Fate
Type: Action/Reflex
Cost: 1 adrenaline

Whenever you or someone you can see makes a [[Skill Test]], you may spend 1 [[Adrenaline]] to replace any card revealed during the skill test with the next card in the deck. You may use this ability after revealing a card, but before any effects take place (See: [[Skill Test]]). Additionally,

##### Level 3:
###### Weave Fate
Type: Action/Reflex
Cost: 2 adrenaline

Whenever you empower a [[Skill Test]], you may spend 2 additional [[Adrenaline]] to [[Glitch]] it. This does not count towards the aces needed to create a paradox (See: [[Glitch]]). If you get an Ace during this process you may glitch a 3rd time. 



### Reverse
##### Level 1:
###### Deja Vu
Type: Action/Reflex

Whenever an Actor you can see uses a [[Actions#Reflex Actions|Reflex Actions]] you may choose to cancel it. The cost of the action is still paid. You may only do this once per round.

##### Level 2: 
###### Jamais Vu
Type: Action/Reflex
Notes: Should this cost cards to use? More Adrenaline?

Whenever you or someone you can see takes damage, you may spend 2 [[Adrenaline]] to undo the source of that damage. The target recovers the hp they lost. If the source of the damage can move on it's own, you may move it 15 ft in any direction.

##### Level 3:
###### Presque Vu
Type: Action
Cost: 3 Cards, 3 Adrenaline

On your turn, you may spend 3 cards and 3 [[Adrenaline]] to put one target you can see within 30ft into stasis for 2 rounds. The targets [[Health]] cannot be changed, they cannot be moved, and they cannot take actions. At the end of your turn on the 2nd round, you may choose to have the target regain [[Health]] equal to your [[Mind]] score. Once a target has been effected by this ability it cannot effect them again until a day has passed. Only one target can be effected by this ability at a time.


### Accelerate
##### Level 1:
###### Accelerate
Type: Action
Cost: 1 Cards

Once on your turn, may expend 1 cards to **accelerate** an ally (including yourself). That Actor reduces the cost of their next action by up to 3 cards.  You cannot target an actor with this ability twice in a row.

##### Level 2:
###### Momentum
Type: Passive

When targeting an ally other than yourself with Accelerate, you gain 2 adrenaline and draw a card.

###### Terminal Velocity
Type: Reflex Action
Cost: 1 Card

Whenever the last target of your accelerate ability makes a [[Fire a weapon]] or [[Swing a melee weapon]] action you may choose to expend a card from your hand and add it as a damage card. This card is not assigned to the weapons magazine after the action has resolved. If the attack becomes a partial hit, the card you expended adds half its value to the damage.

##### Level 3:
###### Flash
Type: Passive

You may choose to reveal your turn order card from your hand instead of expending it at the start of the round. Additionally, whenever turn order is decided you may choose one ally to reveal a card from the top of their deck. If the revealed card is a higher value then their turn order card, then they may return the turn order card to their hand and use the new card as their turn order card. If the revealed card is a lower value, then the target may draw the revealed card.
