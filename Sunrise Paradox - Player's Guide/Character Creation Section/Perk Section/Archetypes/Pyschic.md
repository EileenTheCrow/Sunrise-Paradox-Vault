Psychics are those that have learned (or possible been infected with) the [[Super Structures]]' otherworldly knowledge on how to bend the mind and space. A psychic is able to alter the perceptions of someone's mind directly or rapidly warp large areas of space to move, bend, or destroy anything within it. A psychic specializes in causing large disruptions in their opponents formations or completely disabling a single target.

### Gravity
##### Level 1:
Type: Action
Cost: 1-3 Cards, 1-3 Adrenaline both of which must be the same number

On your turn, you may expend up to 3 cards and 3 [[Adrenaline]] to pick an equal number of living targets you can see within 15ft of each other. Those targets take damage equal to the values on the cards expended. If they use a [[Move]] [[Actions#Reflex Actions|Reflex Action]], they take damage divided by the amount of adrenaline spent to use this action.

##### Level 2:
Type: Action
Cost: 3 Cards, 4 Adrenaline

 You may expend 3 cards and spend 4 [[Adrenaline]] to pick a target within 100ft of you. All living actors within 30ft of the target take damage at the end of the targets turn. If the target moved during their turn, all actors in the area take 6 damage, otherwise they take 3 damage. This effect lasts for the next 2 round until the end of the targets turn.

##### Level 3:
Type: Passive
Notes: Lower the cost?

At start of your turn, you may spend 5 [[Adrenaline]] to **Collapse** all actors that have been effected by one of your Gravity Abilities. Each actor you **Collapse** is inflicted with 1 tier of [[Immobilize]], is [[Prone|Proned]], and takes damage  ????

Type: Passive
Cost: 3 Cards

You may expend 3 cards to pick a target you can see within 100ft. Until the end of your next turn, that target is effected by one of the following effects of your choice:

- They must use the [[Move]] action to move directly away from you.
- The cost of their first [[Actions#Reflex Actions|Reflex Action]] is doubled.
