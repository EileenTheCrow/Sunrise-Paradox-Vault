Distortionists are those that have learned how to manipulate matter and its properties to suit their needs. A Distortionist uses their abilities to detect and create [[Distortions]] for various purposes. Their abilities are not only useful for out maneuvering the opponent, but also sabotaging them and defending your allies.


## Paths
### Rupture Sight
##### Level 1:
Type: Unique

Whenever you are within 30ft of a Distortion it becomes revealed.

Additionally, whenever [[Combat]] begins, the [[Maker]] reveals 3 [[Distortions]] within 100ft. If there are less than 3 distortions revealed, you may place distortions until there are 3 revealed. The distortions you place must be one of the listed distortions below, without selecting any option more than once. Additionally, you may not place a distortion if placing it would immediately trigger its effect.

###### Ignition:
Place this distortion on a space you can see within range. Whenever an actor moves within a space 10ft or closer to **Ignition** the radius is covered with a powerful fire. An actor in this area ignites. While an actor is ignited they take 10 damage upon being ignited and again at the end of their turn until they are no longer ignited. This damage is reduced by their agility score. An actor may use the [[First Aid]] action to end the effect of ignite.

While this distortion is **enhanced**, actors that trigger its effect take 13 damage upon being ignited. Additionally, the [[First Aid]] cost to end the effect of **Ignition** is increased to 3 cards instead of 2.

###### Displacement:
Place this distortion on a point you can see within range. Whenever an actor moves within a 10ft square around the point of **Displacement** it pulses, sending the actor flying back. The actor is pushed back 25ft and drops whatever equipment they have readied. The distance they are pushed back is reduced by 5ft for every 2 points the actor has in [[Physique]]. The actor then takes 2 damage for every 5ft they were pushed.

While this distortion is **enhanced**, actors that trigger its effect take 3 damage for every 5ft they were pushed instead of 2 and they are pushed an additional 10ft.

###### Stun:
Place this distortion on a point you can see within range. Whenever an actor moves within a space 15ft or closer to **Stun** it arcs, shocking then with electricity. The actor becomes stunned. Their movement is halved and all [[Fire a weapon]] and [[Swing a melee weapon]] direct hits they deal instead become partial hits and all partial hits they deal instead do no damage. They also take 2 damage anytime they spend an adrenaline point. This effect lasts until the end of the actors next turn.

While this distortion is **enhanced**, actors that trigger its effect take 3 damage per adrenaline spend instead of 2. Additionally they cannot take the [[Fire a weapon]] or [[Swing a melee weapon]] actions while under the effect of **Stun**.

##### Level 2:
Type: Action

You may spend 2 cards during your turn to **activate** any one distortion you have revealed. When you do the effective radius of the distortion increases by 10ft for 1 round. If a target is within this radius when activated, the distortion triggers.

An activated distortion becomes **enhanced** while it is activated.

##### Level 3:
