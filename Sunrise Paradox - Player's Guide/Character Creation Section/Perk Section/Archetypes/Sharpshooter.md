### Marksman
##### Level 1:
Type: Action
Cost: 2 cards

You may expend 2 cards to enter a Marksman's stance. While in this stance your damage dealt by ranged weapons is doubled. The stance is exited when you take an action other than the [[Fire a weapon]] action.

##### Level 2: 
Type: Passive

When you take the [[Fire a weapon]] action, you may choose one of your damage cards to use on a different target. Choose a target within range that is within 30ft of the original target. That target receives a Partial Hit with the chosen damage card. The original target only takes damage from damage cards that were assigned to it.
