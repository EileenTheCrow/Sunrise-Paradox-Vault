### Traversal
##### Level 1:
Type: Passive

Whenever you move, crouching does not effect your speed. Additionally, the first time you are targeted with the [[Fire a weapon]] or [[Swing a melee weapon]] action in a round, you may [[Move]] up to your speed as a Reflex Action without expending any cards.

##### Level 2:
Type: Passive

You may spend 2 [[Adrenaline]] at the start of your turn to enter an Agile Stance, which you remain until you choose to return to your normal stance. While in this stance, your [[Speed]] increases by 10ft and you may move 10ft anytime you take the [[Swing a melee weapon]] or [[Fire a weapon]] actions. This movement cannot be responded to by a [[Actions#Reflex Actions|Reflex Actions]]. While in this stance you can only take [[Actions#Offensive Actions|Offensive Actions]], [[Actions#Movement Actions|Movement Actions]], and [[Actions#Reflex Actions|Reflex Actions]].

##### Level 3:
Type: Passive

Whenever you first enter Agile Stance you cannot be targeted by the [[Return Fire]] [[Actions#Reflex Actions|Reflex Actions]] until the end of your next turn. Additionally, you may now take [[First Aid]] or [[Switching Weapons]] actions while in Agile Stance.


### Target Spotted
##### Level 1:
Type: Action
Tags: Utility, De-buff

You may expand 1 card during your turn to ***Mark*** a target you can see. Until either you or that target dies or enters [[Critical Condition]], they take 2 additional damage from all sources and if you or an ally of yours moves, they may move an additional 10ft so long as they end their turn closer to that target then they started.

##### Level 2:
Type: Passive
You may ***Mark*** an additional target when you use [[#Target Spotted]] ability. Additionally, when the [[Fire a weapon]] or [[Swing a melee weapon]] action are used against the targets, they lose 1 [[Adrenaline]].

##### Level 3:
Type: Passive

Targets effected by your Target Spotted ability cannot enter [[Stealth]]. Additionally, the first time you use the [[Return Fire]] or [[#Brutal Counter]] action on someone effected by the Target Spotted ability it does not expand your [[Actions#Reflex Actions|Reflex Actions]] for this round.

Additionally, you gain the following special [[Actions#Reflex Actions|Reflex Actions]] against targets effected by your [[#Target Spotted]] ability.

###### Brutal Counter
(Reflex Action - requires a melee weapon)
If a target within your melee range attempts to take a [[Actions#Utility Actions|Utility Action]] or [[Actions#Movement Actions|Movement Action]] you may use a [[Actions#Reflex Actions|Reflex Actions]] to make a [[Swing a melee weapon]] attack against them. 


### Deathly Precision
##### Level 1:
When you perform a [[Swing a melee weapon]] Action, you may spend 2 [[Adrenaline]] to enhance it. When you do, if the target does not [[Move]] as a [[Actions#Reflex Actions|Reflex Action]], you may use the [[Swing a melee weapon]] action an additional time (it cannot be enhanced by this ability). If the target does [[Move]] as a [[Actions#Reflex Actions|Reflex Action]], they are inflicted with 1 tier of [[Bleeding]], which lasts until they use a [[First Aid]] action (instead of 3 turns).

##### Level 2: 
Whenever you deal damage to a target using a [[Swing a melee weapon]] action you may also take a [[CQC]] action at no additional cost. Additionally, you may choose to use either [[Brawn]] or [[Agility]] during [[CQC]] contests.

##### Level 3:
If you take a partial hit from a melee weapon and you currently have a melee weapon readied then you take 0 damage instead.
Additionally, if you either kill or put a target in [[Critical Condition]] using [[CQC#Submission|Submission]] then you regain 5 [[Adrenaline]].
