## Paths
### Heavy Weaponry
##### Level 1:
Whenever you take the [[Fire a weapon]] or [[Swing a melee weapon]] actions with a heavy weapon, you may deal a partial hit to additional targets within range for every damage card you assign beyond the first. The attack misses against the additional targets if they use a reflex action that would normally make a direct hit a partial hit (ex: [[Move]], [[Return Fire]], etc.)

### Threatening Presence
##### Level 1: 
Whenever you deal damage to a target you may choose to have you and that target both draw a card, reveal it, and both of you add your physique score to the value (treat face cards as if they are 10). If you have the highest total, then the target can only use actions that cause damage if they damage you in the process. Otherwise, the target must choose a different action.

### Sentinel
##### Level 1: 
The first time you would drop below 1/2 your [[Health]], you remain at 1/2 your [[Health]] instead.

##### Level 2: 
You may spend 3 Adrenaline during your turn to enter a **Brace** stance. While in **Brace** stance, you reduce all damage you receive by 4, move at half speed, and cannot be moved or have your stance changed against your will. You may end this stance at the start of your turn. It also ends whenever you take the [[Fire a weapon]], [[Swing a melee weapon]], and [[CQC]].
