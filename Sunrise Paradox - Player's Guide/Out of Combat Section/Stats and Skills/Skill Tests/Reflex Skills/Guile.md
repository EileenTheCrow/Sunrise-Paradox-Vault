Sneak is your ability to move quietly and without detection. You can use sneak to hide objects on your person, hide behind objects, or steal things off of people. Sneak unlike other skills uses a different system. See the [[Stealth]] page to see exactly how to use sneak in and out of combat for the purposes of hiding from hostile actors.
