When a player wants to accomplish something that can't be accomplished with [[Actions]] or other operations, they may be asked to make a skill test. This is usually a way to determine if you can perform a non-trivial task, such as solving a complex equation, repairing a weapon, or vaulting a wall. Occasionally the [[Maker]] may have tests for trivial challenges if they are aware that you have below average [[Stats]], usually to emphasize your weaknesses against your strengths. In this same vein you will have plenty of opportunities to show off your prowess throughout your missions.

There are 3 different [[Qualifications]] for [[Skills]] that are shown in the chart below: Experienced, Trained, and Mastered. These [[Qualifications]] represent their exposure and training in the skill. Whenever a player makes a skill test they add the qualification bonus to the [[Skills]] associated [[Stats]] value and that is the target value. Whenever a player attempts a feat related to the skill the [[Maker]] comes up with a level of success to complete the task as shown below to represent the difficulty of the test. The player then reveals cards in order from the top of the deck until they reveal 3 cards. For every card less than their target value their level of success increases a tier. Once cards are revealed the player may decide if they would like to spend an [[Adrenaline]] point to empower the test. If they do all face cards change to their empowered rules. Resolved any aces in your original hand, then all other face cards are resolved from right to left in order of appearance (see the chart below).

Whenever a player wants to do a skill test, but is being actively hindered by another actor that player and the actor make a [[Challenge Test]].

 #### Example of Play
As an example let's say you are experienced in [[Literacy]] and have a 6 [[Mind]] then your [[Literacy]] value is 7. If you wanted to attempt to recall some complex history that the [[Maker]] determined required a Strong Success, you would start by drawing your hand. Once you've drawn your first hand you can then decide if you want to empower your draw or take it as it. It's important to remember that even though empowering your draw can be risky, it is more likely than not to increase your odds of success.
Below is an example of a normal success. If you were trying to beat a skill value of 6 for example, the below hand would yield you a **normal success**.

If you wanted to attempt to recall a difficult physics equation, the [[Maker]] might determine that the task requires an extreme success. This means to succeed you'd have to attempt the test and get 3 total successes to pass.

The below test is an example of a what an empowered hand might be like. First you start by drawing your hand and then do the empowered face card effects. This
