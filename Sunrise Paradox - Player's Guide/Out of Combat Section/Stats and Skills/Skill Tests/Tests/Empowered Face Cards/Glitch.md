If you empower an ace, place it to the side and replace it. Draw an additional hand of 3 cards. Resolve all the empowered cards of the first hand then the second and then pick which hand to keep for the test. 

If you ever draw 2 aces in an empowered hand it becomes a paradox: an automatic extreme success.
