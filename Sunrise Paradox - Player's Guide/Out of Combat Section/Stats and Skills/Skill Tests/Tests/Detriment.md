Parent page: [[Skill Test]]

 Whenever your character has [[Detriment]] on a [[Skill Test]], you make that skill test by drawing 1 less card for each [[Detriment]] you have on that test. You can have no more than 2 [[Detriment]] on a test, just as you may not have more than 2 [[Foresight]] on a [[Skill Test]].
