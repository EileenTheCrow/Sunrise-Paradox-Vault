Parent Page: [[Skill Test]]

Whenever your character has foresight on a [[Skill Test]], you make that skill test by drawing an additional card for each [[Foresight]] you have on that test. You can have no more than 2 [[Foresight]] on a test, just as you may not have more than 2 [[Detriment]] on a [[Skill Test]].
