Parent Page: [[Physique]]

Your Character's [[Carry Capacity]] is equal to twice your [[Physique]] score. When you carry an object it takes up a number of slots in your inventory as listed in it's description. If the number of slots is not given in the [[Equipment]] section, then the [[Maker]] will come up with a number of slots appropriate for the item.
