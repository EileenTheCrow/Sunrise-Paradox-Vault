Your character has three stats that govern their abilities, defenses, and personality.

### [[Reflex]]
This stat represents your character's [[Speed]], reaction time, and dexterity. Your character's reflexes dictate their ability to use firearms and move to [[Cover]] quickly, as well as other feats that test their spacial awareness and codination.


### [[Physique]]
This stat represents your character's endurance, resistance, and overall [[Health]]. Your character's [[Physique]] determines how much damage they can take, how much [[Health]] they recover from treating a wound, and how powerful their build is. [[Physique]] is also used to determine what weapons you can wield, [[CQC]] ability, and how much you can carry.


### [[Mind]]
This stat represents your character's wit, cunning, and charisma. Your character's [[Mind]] determines how well they can withstand psychic attacks, how well they can handle mental trauma, and their ability to use psychic based offense. [[Mind]] is also used to detect sneaking opponents, find hidden objects, or help diffuse tense situations with words.
