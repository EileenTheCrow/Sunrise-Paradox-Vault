Awareness is a representation of a character's perception of the player's as well as the player's perception of opponents. Normally all actors are **Aware** of each others presence, but there may be character's use the [[Guile]] skill to enter [[Stealth]]. In these scenarios, actors may have less awareness of the player. 

#### Unaware
All actors that did not see the player enter [[Stealth]] are **Unaware** of the player. While an actor is **unaware**, they continue as they normally would. Actors that are attacked while **unaware** can be instantly killed or knocked out by another actor, but this is always at the maker's discretion. If the maker so chooses, the actor may instead receive a direct hit from the attack as some actors may be strong enough to withstand even a direct hit while **unaware**.

#### Alert
Actors that have perceived the player in some capacity are **Alert**. **Alert** actors know that someone or something is wrong, but they not be able to tell exactly what. **Alert** actors can actively make [[observation]] [[Skill Test]]s to try and become **aware** of the actor in [[Stealth]]. If ever the sneaking actors [[Stealth]] is broken, all actors that can perceive them become **aware** of their presence. While in this state, if the sneaking actor attacks an **alert** actor, they **alert** actor may make an [[Agility]] check against their [[Guile]] [[Skill Test]] total (see [[Stealth]]). If the actor succeeds they get a [[Actions#Reflex Actions|Reflex Actions]]. Otherwise, they get no [[Actions#Reflex Actions|Reflex Actions]].

#### Aware
This is the default state of an actor perceiving another actor. While in this state All actors get their normal reflex [[Actions]] and [[Actions]] and can target anyone not behind [[Cover]].

The above states of awareness are essential for [[Stealth]], which use these states to define how a player proceeds during [[Stealth]]. The [[Maker]] needs to identify what state any actor that could spot a player is in. This will be covered more in the [[Maker]] notes below.
