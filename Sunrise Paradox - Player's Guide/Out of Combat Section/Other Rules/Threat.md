Threat is a determination of a player and their parties overall perception of danger and urgency. The more urgent and dangerous some event is, the higher the threat rating. When a given scenario is occuring, the [[Maker]] will give measure from the below ratings to the players to determine the initial threat value. The [[Maker]] may increase or decrease the threat as the scenario continues: the higher the threat the close the scenario gets to taking turns to resolve the scenario.

| The Threat is...  | High Urgency | Medium Urgency | Low Urgency |
| ----------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ----------- |
| **High Danger**   | High         | High           | Moderate    |
| **Medium Danger** | High         | Moderate       | Low         |
| **Low Danger **   | Moderate     | Low            | Low         | 

High Threat: This level implies immediate and significant danger to the party and it's allies. High Threats immediately call for a turn based resolution. High threat scenarios usually are caused by [[Combat]] breaking out, an obstacle threatening a player's life, or any other significant turning point.

Medium Threat: This level implies a looming or growing danger, or an immediate problem with only a moderate amount of danger. These are situations that still have a chance to de-escalate, but have a possible chance of going south. These scenarios don't yet require a turn based resolution, but require caution to prevent such an outcome.

Low Threat: This level implies your everyday encounter. Though obstacles may stand in your way, they don't have the same lasting consequences or immediate importance that the other levels do. These scenarios can likely be solved with a simple hand wave, narration, or dice roll.

At any time a character may make a [[Threat Assessment]] check to determine the current Threat as well as the likely hood of the Threat Escalating.
